# WebSerial
Communication between browser and serial (microcontroller)

Hi folks! This is the original post on r/arduino :
https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/tc6znz/need_help_with_web_serial/

 Hello, I am trying to make a generic web browser interface to communicate with an Arduino UNO. I found a few examples online, and some pretty good documentation, but I would need help understanding it. Essentially, if all goes well, I want to make a new example that is as stripped down as as possible and publicly available on github.

The objectives are :

 Drop-down menu for baud rate

 Textbox for instruction and a button to send

 Small terminal window (only 1 line)

If you know how to approach this, help would really be appreciated!

Public repository, if you want to help:

These are the links I found, but they are above my skill level right now, maybe you can help?
